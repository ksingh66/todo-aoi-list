Type "make" in the terminal to compile the program. Then type "./todo_list" to run the program.
Note that the tasks are stored in RAM and **terminating the program will get rid of the tasks**.

# Outline
Dynamically allocate space for each task.
A Linked list will be used as the data structure that represents each task. The pointer part of the node will point to the next task to be completed with the last task pointing to NULL.

## Linked list 
 We need to write a header file for the Linked list data structure, this header file must include functions to print the list, replace two existing tasks, add a new task and remove a task. 
 ADDING A TASK
 ![linked list add](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/327c6169-9a0f-4a4d-89e1-9250afe754be)
# Result
The final program acts as a complete linked list, that is able to show tasks, add and remove tasks as well as swap two tasks.
