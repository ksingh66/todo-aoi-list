# Plan for the project
The idea is to *dynamically allocate memory* for each of the tasks in the to-do list.

We will have 3 files **linked_list.h**,**linked_list.c** and lastly **main.c**
## Linked-list
Linked-lists will be used to keep track of the order of the tasks.

We will use the header of the data structure linked-list to use in our main file.
The main purpose of the project is to get familiar with the Linked-list data structure.
Update Jun 18: linked list data stucture initialized

To update soon: Finish all functions for the linked list ADT

To update in future: Dynamically allocate space

## Main
Key: user can change the priority order- additionally when a user a done with a task we want the program to output the order of the new priority tasks.

The UI prompts the user to either add a task, mark a task as done or change the priority order. 

BONUS: having multiple users would be good too.

BONUT: Encrypting the content of the files would also be good too.
